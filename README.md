Comfort Corners - My Portfolio Project
Introduction
Comfort Corners is a web application I developed to help caregivers and parents of children with special needs find safe and accessible playing areas in their local community. As a caregiver for a child on the autism spectrum, I experienced the challenge of finding suitable spaces that accommodate the unique needs of my child. This application aims to bridge that gap by providing a platform for users to search for and discover these specialized play areas.
